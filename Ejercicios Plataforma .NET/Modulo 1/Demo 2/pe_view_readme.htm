<hr/><!---------------------About the <b><i>pe_view</i></b> Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <b><i>pe_view</i></b> Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>pe_view</i></b> combines a collection of PE manipulation code that was written 
over the years.  Following the theme of many of my tools, this tool does not 
rely on the use of the windows API to parse the PE structure, so it can be 
compiled and run on other platforms.   Currently there are compiled versions
for Windows and Linux.</p>

<p>While there are a number of freely available pe tools online (many of which 
are more capable then pe_view and offer editing features), I ended up writing 
my own version of a pe viewer some years ago primarily to understand the 
PE format in more depth and to have something that was Windows agnostic. </p> 

<p><b><i>pe_view</i></b> can extract executable components from all versions of Windows 
executables (not just the ones with a PE format). This includes the old DOS 
and NE formats that would run in some in the older versions of Windows.  
Unfortunately, <b><i>pe_view</i></b> has not been updated to handle the .NET internals. </p> 

<p>Prior versions included a disassembler with the viewer, but ended up removing 
it from the 'free' version, since it only handled the Intel x86 instruction 
set and not the amd64 instruction set. This is something that I want to 
update in the future.  There are most likely other boundary conditions that 
may not parse properly... especially for those PE files that use some sort 
of obfuscation technique for anti-reverse engineering. As those are found, 
the tool is updated with a fix to handle the boundary condition. </p>

<p><b><i>pe_view</i></b> makes use of the <a href="http://www.fox-toolkit.org/">FOX-toolkit</a>.    
FOX is a C++ based Toolkit for developing GUI applications that can
easily port across various platforms by compiling the source for the 
appropriate OS.  FOX is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public 
License (LGPL), with a FOX Library License addendum.</p>

<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased. 
Contact <a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a> for more 
details about the using this tool for business and/or casework use.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Usage---------------------->
<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>Since pe_view was designed to be a GUI based tool, one can just double click
on pe_view and select [File -&gt; Open] menu combination to operate on a target 
portable executable (PE) file. Once a PE file is loaded, besides reviewing 
all the internal components via the tree view that is displayed, one can:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Dump the strings associated with the PE file.  Strings are
        consider to be at least 5 consecutive printable characters.
    <pre>
    [View -&gt; Ascii chars]
    [View -&gt; Unicode chars]
    </pre></li>

    <li>Search for a hex pattern or a string within the PE file
    <pre>
    [View -&gt; Find]
    </pre></li>

    <li>Dump the binary data from any location within the PE file as a hexadecimal view to the user.
    <pre>
    [View -&gt; Dump Hex]
    </pre></li>

    <li>dump summary stats about a PE file as compared to other PE files on the system.
    <pre>
    [View -&gt; Collection Compare].
    </pre></li>

    <li>One can modify which files on the system to use as a comparison by loading a custom configuration file.
    <pre>
    [Option -&gt; Load Config file]
    </pre></li>

    <li>Dump some summary stats about the PE file: 
    <pre>
    [View -&gt; Packaging]
    </pre></li>

    <li>Use a PEiD signature file to aid in PE identification</li>
</ul>


<p>The second option to use pe_view is much more limited, but allows one
to dump summary stats information via the command line.  This is useful if
processing many PE files triaging them into categories.  To aid in this,
pe_view can handle std input in file processing. </p>

<p>All command line options that don't use the GUI need the option -nogui as 
one of the arguments.   Second, all output needs to be redirected to a 
file (windows version only), since the windows version does not output to 
the command prompt. </p>

<pre>
    (a) option w/o std input processing
        pe_view  -file &lt;pefile&gt; [-peid &lt;peid file&gt;] -out &lt;results file&gt;

    (b) option w std input processing
        // windows specific
        dir *.exe /b /s | pe_view -pipe [-peid &lt;peid file&gt;] -out &lt;results file&gt;

        // linux specific
        find /home -name *.exe -type f | pe_view -pipe [-peid &lt;peid file&gt;] -out &lt;results file&gt;
        ls /home/win32_samples/*.dll | pe_view -pipe [-peid &lt;peid file&gt;] -out &lt;results file&gt;
</pre>

<p>The help for which command line options are available can be seen via
the following options:</p>

<pre>
    pe_view --help 
    pe_view /?
    pe_view -?

<h2><a name="package">PE Packaging</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>Summary info about how the PE file was packaged.</p>

<p>Staring with version 0.71, there is additional functionality that gives a
summary of some of the PE statistics on how the PE file was compiled and/or
packaged.  Included with this analysis is the ability to used any PEiD 
signature file that is available online (see reference 5 below). </p> 

<p>To load a PEiD signature file, one can do this by selecting the menu option</p>
<pre>
    [Option -&gt; Load PE Signature]
</pre>

<p>To view the summary information about how the PE file was packaged, select</p>
<pre>
    [View -&gt; Packaging]
</pre>

<p>There is also a command line option to load a PEiD signature file on
pe_view startup, using the switch -peid &lt;path/file&gt;.</p>
</div>


<hr/><!---------------------PEiD Signatures---------------------->
<h2><a name="peid">PEiD Signatures</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>Reference <a href="#peid_refs">4</a> below has some links to locations where one can obtain a PEiD
signature file or get more information about its format.  Below are the rules
for how pe_view parses PEiD signature files.</p>

<pre>
  1. Signature file is a text document

  2. Each line is parsed using the following rules.
    a. The following are keywords:
        ';'
        '[' ']'
        'signature ='
        'ep_only ='
        '??'

    b. General Rules.
        i.   each line is parsed separately
        ii.  a line that starts w/ a semi-colon ';', then the entire line is ignore
              and used for comments
        iii. a blank line is ignored

    c. The name of the signature in encompassed in square brackets []. The opening
        square bracket should start at the beginning of the line.

    d. The signature is preceded by the keyword 'signature ='.  The signature is 
        represented by hexadecimal bytes where each byte is separated by spaces.  
        Wildcard bytes are represented by '??'

    e. If the signature is meant to be scanned at the PE entrypoint, it will be
        designated as 'ep_only = true'; otherwise if the signature is to be search
        throughout the file contents, it will be designated as 'ep_only = false;

    f. For version this version of pe_view, only the signatures that are specified
        as 'ep_only = true' are used.  Later versions of pe_view may incorporate 
        entire PE scanning.

  3. Below is an example of a signature:

        [Microsoft Visual C++ 8]
        signature = E8 ?? ?? 00 00 E9 ?? ?? FF FF
        ep_only = true
</pre>
</div>


<hr/><!---------------------PE Analysis---------------------->
<h2><a name="analysis">PE Analysis</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>pe_view incorporates the standard extraction of both ASCII and Unicode strings.
(ref. View menu). Strings are considered to be at least 5 consecutive printable 
characters.</p>

<p>One may also desire to look at how one PE file compares to a collection of PE files.  
For the simple case, <b><i>pe_view</i></b> takes some predefined PE files that are part of the 
running operating system and uses these to compare the PE file you are analyzing. 
To use this comparison option, select the 'File Compare' in the 'View' menu.</p>

<p>If one desires to customize which collection of PE files to compare against, one can
specify an alternative list of PE files to be used as the collection. This can be 
done by first generating a text file containing the path\filename of each PE file 
on a separate line and reading that file into <b><i>pe_view</i></b> by using the 
"Option"-&gt;"Load Config".</p>

<p>See config file format in the section below for details on using this option.</p>

<p>The output during this type of compare will be one line per PE file, with the target
PE file on the top.</p>

<p>The following syntax is used when displaying the results:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>pe_view also allows one to generate a histogram of any of the sections in
the PE file.  This can be accessed by highlighting the section or resource that 
one wants to compute a histogram for and selecting from the context aware menu 
(eg. right click) and select the 'Stats' item.</p>
</div>


<hr/><!---------------------PE Collection Configuration File Format---------------------->
<h2><a name="config">PE Collection Configuration File Format</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>These files are text files that list the PE files to use as a collection
to compare a target PE with.  Currently there are 3 types of collection
types: (a) executable, (b) dynamic link library and (c) driver.  The 
parsing rules for these config files are as follows:</p>
<pre>
    General Rules.
        1. each line is parsed separately
        2. a line that starts w/ a double forward slash (eg //) is ignored
            and used for comments
        3. a blank line is ignored
        
    Lines listing pe files
        1. Each pe file is listed on a separate line (w/ associated path)
        2. Each group of pe files (consecutive listing of pe files) 
             should have a separate line defining the type of PE files
             identified in the group.

        3. The types of PE files collections include one of the following: 
        executables, dlls, or driver files.  To help the parser tell which 
        collection goes with what file, use the following declarations on a 
        separate line:
            [exe files]
            [dll files]
            [driver files]

        The files listed (one file per line) after the above type declaration
        will be categorized with that collection.  
</pre>

<h3>Example config file</h3>


<pre>
    // executables
    [exe files]
    systemroot\system32\cmd.exe
    systemroot\system32\calc.exe
    systemroot\system32\services.exe
    ...

    // dynamic link libraries
    [dll files]
    systemroot\system32\user32.dll
    systemroot\system32\gdi32.dll
    systemroot\system32\crypt32.dll
    systemroot\system32\msvcrt.dll
    ...

    // drivers
    [driver files]
    systemroot\system32\drivers\ntfs.sys
    systemroot\system32\drivers\ndis.sys
    systemroot\system32\ntoskrnl.exe
    systemroot\system32\hal.dll
    ...
</pre>

<h3>Loading a user defined config file</h3>

<p>To run a user defined config file, in file Options menu, select 
'Load Configfile',  whereupon an open file dialog box will allow you to 
navigate to the config file you wish to load.</p>

<p>After the config file is loaded, it will be parsed and the files will
specified will be analyzed and the PE internals extracted.  A summary
of the extraction results will then be displayed.  Then any file that
is loaded into the pe_view can be analyzed against this loaded configuration,
via the View menu -&gt; 'Collection Compare'.</p>

<p>If a config file is not loaded by the user, pe_view will try to examine
the target file against a predefined list of pe files.</p>
</div>


<hr/><!---------------------Extracting PE Resources---------------------->
<h2><a name="extracting">Extracting PE Resources</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to extract fragments from the PE file and examine the
fragments w/ another tool.  Resources in the PE file, for example, can contain
other files, like: png, jpeg, zipped, or even another PE file.  pe_view allows
one to extract any portion of the PE file that the viewer displays.</p>  

<p>For example, if one wants to extract a resource, one can select any resource
in the resource table displayed and using the context aware menu (eg. right 
clicking on a highlighted resource) and select the 'Save' menu item. </p>

<p>After saving the desired fragment, one can use the appropriate viewer to view
the extracted data.</p>

<h2><a name="auth">Authentication and License File</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or all of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>
